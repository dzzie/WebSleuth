	added input type=select -> text
	      input type= check-> text
              Probe Dir Listings (looks for dir index in each folder above current)

	oops had a roll back in testinputs plugin, lost support for default vals
        should be back but havent thorougly tested 100%

	help file updated, look for 'new' icon , still forgot to include the inject
	range notation :-\

	INJECT 'test[01-20-1]' ...
                     ^^-Start - Stop - Step 
	tries test01, test02, .. test20
	a two char start like 01 means use 1 char buffer so will always be 2 char 
 	input

Release 1.2.3
	ProxyManager form added - can now switch between proxies from
		drop down in about 2 seconds VS. lengthy std IE dialogue
		tested exclusivly on IE6, Win2k..should be ok in others
		manipulates registry directly.
	IE Browser Integration - Adds a hot button to the IE Browser
		so that you can fire it up from a regular browser window
		and it will automatically startup with current page loaded.
		
	Bugs: Extract Script routines still buggy...because web pages 
		can contain scripts in <head> section and we can only 
		access <body> section with DHTML object scripts.length can
		be off. Also suspect iframes add to scripts.length of main
		document and throw off count. Functionality left intact because
		it still proves quite useful just be aware that index may be
		off. Err handling is in place so will not crash. Sorry for the
		annoyance.
