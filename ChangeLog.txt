ChangeLog

Release 1.3.1 
		Added Features: 
			
			Toolbox -> Advanced -> Window Sniper
				Lets you snag source and stats on standard IE windows
				great for modal popups or places you cant seem to get
				with main sleuth. Amazing code from Eduardo A. Morcillo
				
				http://www.domaindlx.com/e_morcillo/default.asp
			

			Cookie on top - new form to watch cookies realtime <--very cool

			Navigate To Frame - gives you frameover so you can 
				snap browser right to specific frame <--nice
				beats old way of having to nav through frameset

			Color Find button in source view: Highlights all instances 
				of phrase in find box to specified color.

			Dirty Source Prompt - remind you to update IE after source edit
			Use Mouse Over Nav bar - eyecandy 

		Changed Behaviors:
			Source is only set when you go from browser to source..this way
				you can make changes, goto other tabs and come back
				and not loose changes	

		Bug Fixes:
			   ouch found a couple residual bugs from all the changes :(
			   Fixed crash in Raw request response box right click
			   Fixed err induced in register plugin routines
		
		Bugs: I know updated frmRawRequest has some logic bugs I will hop on
			it soon mabey i over did the behaviors :P



Release 1.3 Major release
		Added in reference to tab control for frmRawreq and frmMain..
			if it complains about no TABCTL32.OCX it is included
			in the new zip just run the vbs installer script for it

		options are now checkboxes..easier to set see options tab
			more to come there

		When you edit source two new features:
			1) if you have a selection in IE..you only edit that <--neat
			2) once you are done editing...you MUST CLICK UPDATE IE to save

		frmRawRequest is entirly new and hopefully more efficient !

		Extract forms -> right click -> raw request now initilizes off form!

		Access to Internet Options dialogue built in

		Can now extract embeded script automatically Extract Scripts and see :)

		Very major UI changes...so new bugs are quite possible...but should
			be much more usable

		Almost have winInet api raw request form done so you will soon be 
			able to make ssl raw requests...messy api there :(

		Probably more, but ughh..me brain is fried...

Release 1.2.34b minor release - March 8
		
		another bug fix for iframed pages not allowing source editing
		added functionality to edit form values from lower listbox

Release 1.2.34: bug fix release Feb 14
		
		eeks Found one more bug just fixed  Feb.15 - fixed one last crash 
			in framed document analysis for html transformations. 

                Bookmarks Feature added
		Numerous bug fixes in relation to framed pages.
		Now can view source for any frame you want, no more crashs
		Html transformations now work with framed pages. (hidden->text etc..)
		Extract Scripts bugs finally quenched. Entire extraction process changed.
		Test Inputs plugin code simplified,script manager removed now 
			shells notepad and reloads script after process ends.

Release 1.2.33
	added:
		Actions -> Frames Overview - Shows frames list by name and nesting, Leave
			Index string blank to refer to inital frameset document.
		
		Actions -> Embed Script Env - embeds html page in remote source with
				simple javascript enviroment to examine objects, values
				etc...can embed it on whatever frame you want as well
				excellent for trying to play with huge deep nested
				framesets with complex scripting...
		
		Actions -> Probe Directories - checks for dir listing on every folder
				above current path

		Generate Report - now give you the option to log body.innerhtml in
				the report as well.
 
Release 1.2.32
	added input type=select -> text
	      input type= check-> text
              Probe Dir Listings (looks for dir index in each folder above current)

	oops had a roll back in testinputs plugin, lost support for default vals
        should be back but havent thorougly tested 100%

	help file updated, look for 'new' icon , still forgot to include the inject
	range notation :-\

	INJECT 'test[01-20-1]' ...
                     ^^-Start - Stop - Step 
	tries test01, test02, .. test20
	a two char start like 01 means use 1 char buffer so will always be 2 char 
 	input

Release 1.2.3
	ProxyManager form added - can now switch between proxies from
		drop down in about 2 seconds VS. lengthy std IE dialogue
		tested exclusivly on IE6, Win2k..should be ok in others
		manipulates registry directly.
	IE Browser Integration - Adds a hot button to the IE Browser
		so that you can fire it up from a regular browser window
		and it will automatically startup with current page loaded.
		
	Bugs: Extract Script routines still buggy...because web pages 
		can contain scripts in <head> section and we can only 
		access <body> section with DHTML object scripts.length can
		be off. Also suspect iframes add to scripts.length of main
		document and throw off count. Functionality left intact because
		it still proves quite useful just be aware that index may be
		off. Err handling is in place so will not crash. Sorry for the
		annoyance.
