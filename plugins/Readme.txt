

These are old open source versions of Sleuth.

The plugins you see in this directory are for
the version 1 plugin framework.

They are the format these 2 open source versions can run.

I had to update the plugin framework because it decided not
to work for some reason with latter service packs. I was going
to update these to eliminate this confusion, but havent had time
yet so I am just throwing them all together here.

1.2.34b was probably first released around late Jan 2002

1.3 was around Mar 31 2002.

1.35 was the next public release and the first that was closed source
1.35 is still free for private and commercial use and is included in
the current installer package.
